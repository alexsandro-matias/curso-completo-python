## üóÇÔ∏è Curriculum  

### 01: Learn the Basics  
- **Topics**: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Conditionals  
- **Description**: Start with Python syntax, variables, basic data types (integers, strings, booleans, etc.), and control flow using conditionals (`if-elif-else`).  

### 02: Loops, Functions, and Built-in Functions  
- **Topics**: `for`/`while` loops, defining functions, Python's built-in functions (e.g., `len()`, `range()`, `print()`).  
- **Description**: Master loops for iteration, create reusable code with functions, and leverage Python‚Äôs powerful built-in tools.  

### 03: Data Structures  
- **Topics**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries  
- **Description**: Explore core data structures for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Learn their methods, use cases, and differences.  

### 04: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Topics**: Classes, Inheritance, Objects  
- **Description**: Dive into OOP principles. Create classes, design hierarchies with inheritance, and instantiate objects to model real-world scenarios.  

### 05: Advanced Topics I  
- **Topics**: Regular Expressions (RegEx), Decorators, Lambda Functions  
- **Description**: Level up with RegEx for pattern matching, use decorators to modify function behavior, and write concise code with lambda expressions.  

### 06: Advanced Topics II  
- **Topics**: Modules, Iterators, Generators  
- **Description**: Learn to organize code into modules, create custom iterators, and use generators for memory-efficient data processing.
